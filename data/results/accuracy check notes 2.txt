The difficulties of tagging Filipino texts:
>>If the original sentence is problematic, I have to revise the original; sometimes the translated text contains too many foreign words. There were sentences that I 

tagged as I see them and wasn't able to revise the translated text. Re-translating them takes too much time. Since the texts are translated works/projects (they 

appeared to be raw), the material itself presents problems as opposed to tagging works from scholarly articles or novels written in Filipino. 
>>There are words in Filipino that can be nouns and can be verbs depending on the usage in the sentence. So this sometimes creates confusion.
>>It really is challenging to the eyes to manually tag so many texts so the errors are unavoidable. 
>>The comprehension of the tagger of what the sentence conveys affects the tags that will be attributed. Sometimes confusion comes up as I encounter other 

words when tagging. I think this attributed to the differences in corresponding tags. 
>>There are many different verb forms in the Filipino language to express a sentence in English. 
E.g.     Bumili ang lalake ng isda sa tindahan.            VBTS_VBAF DTC NNC CCB NNC CCT NNC PMP
    (The man bought fish at the store.) 
    Binili ng lalake ang isda sa tindahan.             VBTS_VBOF CCB NNC DTC NNC CCT NNC PMP or VBTS_VBOF CCB NNC RBL PMP
    (The man bought the fish at the store).             
    Binilhan ng lalake ng isda ang tindahan.         VBTS CCB NNC CCB NNC DTC NNC PMP
    (The man bought fish at the store.)
    Ipinambili ng lalake ng isda ang pera.            VBTS CCB NNC CCB NNC DTC NNC PMP 
    (The man bought fish with the money.)    
    Bumili ang lalake ng isda para sa bata.             VBTS_VBAF DTC NNC CCB NNC RBB NNC PMP
    (The man bought fish for the child. 

    Binigyan ng guro ng mga regalo ang mga bata.         VBTS_VBOF CCB NNC DTCP NNC DTCP NNC PMP
    (The teacher gave gifts to the kids.)
    Ibinigay ng guro sa mga bata ang mga regalo.         VBTS_VBOF CCB NNC CCT DTCP NNC DTCP NNC PMP
    (The teacher gave the kids the gifts.)

>>The Filipino language has many types/forms of reduplication: e.g. naglalakad (walking), lumalakad (walking: actor-focus), lalakad (will walk), maglalakad (will 

walk), kalalakad (just walked), malalakad mo ito, makakalakad (will be able to walk), palalakarin (will be asked to walk/move)
tumatanaw ng utang na loob, tinatanaw ang tanawin, matatanaw ang kabundukan, magtatanaw
other examples: pinagbubuksan, nagsisikain

>>there are words like: basahin, gayahin, ipatong, tanggihan, paputukin, 
E.g. "Basahin mo ang librong ito." 
basa (salitang-ugat)/binasa (past tense)/binabasa (present tense)/babasahin (future tense)
but 'basahin' appears as a future tense and object-focus too (VBTR-VBOF) and more of a command; same with gayahin, ipatong, tanggihan, paputukin, lunukin, 

taguin
the word 'basa' can also be formed as nabasa (read), nababasa (able to read), mababasa (will be able to read) OR nagbasa (read), nagbabasa (reading) , magbabasa 

(will read) or simply magbasa (which is actor-focus and future tense) 

>>There are words also that appear like adverbs, but since those particular words don't describe another verb or adjective, I don't consider them as adverbs. I think 

I was not consistent in tagging those that I've detected as adverbial phrases. For example, "mabilis na tumakbo", should this be tagged as RBD RBD RBD? or this 

should be tagged as: RBD CCP VBAF?
